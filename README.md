A long time ago evil powers and creatures used to roam around freely across worlds breaking barriers and causing havoc across all worlds. In a world devoid of happiness. Everyone lived a miserable life until a group of wizards discovered that both the World of Magic and the World of Shadows was controlled by two stones; The Sun Stone and The Moon Stone. Both of the stones were powerful artifacts that can only be possesed by the greatest of magicians. So the wizards decided to merge their souls forming a single being powerful enough to control both the worlds. With the stones in his hand the powerful wizard banished all evil from the world casting it away far into the depths of hell. The world then became peaceful as it once was. The Wizard locked himself under a village and turned into a stone for the protection of peace. A thousand years later a Grim Reaper opens up a gate between the Fairy World and The Shadow Realm, Grim Reapers have been feared for ages as they bring death upon every living being and can travel through worlds at a speed far greater than the speed light. The Grim Reaper intends to stay and collect The Sun Stone and The Moon Stone, making an offering to the Shadow OverLord who's plan is to open up all the gates of Hell and cast all evil back to the fairy world. You have to aquire the stones from the Grim Reaper and reawaken the Old Wizard in hope that he closes up the gate opened by the Grim Reaper.
